# Network-Anomaly-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Models
 Implemented Anomaly-based intrusion Detection system using NSL-KDD dataset for identifying abnormal behavior in network traffic causing network threats. Evaluated and compared models’ logistic regression, random forest, isolation forest, Auto-Encoder, while random forest model achieved accuracy of 93%.
